\arguments{
\item{one}{geo location as latitude;longitude}

\item{many}{geo locations as latitude;longitude,latitude;longitude,...}

\item{mode}{routing profile to use (currently supported: \code{WALK}, \code{BIKE}, \code{CAR})

Allowed values: WALK, BIKE, RENTAL, CAR, CAR_PARKING, CAR_DROPOFF, ODM, FLEX, TRANSIT, TRAM, SUBWAY, FERRY, AIRPLANE, METRO, BUS, COACH, RAIL, HIGHSPEED_RAIL, LONG_DISTANCE, NIGHT_RAIL, REGIONAL_FAST_RAIL, REGIONAL_RAIL, CABLE_CAR, FUNICULAR, AREAL_LIFT, OTHER.}

\item{max}{maximum travel time in seconds}

\item{maxMatchingDistance}{maximum matching distance in meters to match geo coordinates to the street network}

\item{elevationCosts}{Optional. Default is \code{NONE}.

Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
\itemize{
\item \code{NONE}: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
\item \code{LOW}: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
\item \code{HIGH}: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.
}

As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,
causing a location to appear unreachable.
Increasing the maximum travel time for these segments may resolve this issue.

Elevation cost profiles are currently used by following street modes:
\itemize{
\item \code{BIKE}
}

Allowed values: NONE, LOW, HIGH.}

\item{arriveBy}{true = many to one
false = one to many}

\item{.return_as}{How to return the response. One of 'list' (default), 'string', or 'raw'.}

\item{.json_parser}{JSON parser when \code{.return_as = 'list'}. One of 'RcppSimdJson' (default) or 'jsonlite'.}

\item{.headers}{Named list of additional HTTP headers to include.}

\item{.auth}{Bearer token string or a function \code{function(req) req} to apply custom auth.}

\item{.throttle_rate}{Requests per second (numeric). If set, throttling is applied.}

\item{.build_only}{If TRUE, return the unperformed request object.}

\item{.server}{Override the server URL for this call.}

\item{.endpoint}{A string to override the path for this specific request (e.g., '/v2/users/{id}'). If provided, it will be used instead of the default path from the specification.}

\item{.referer}{Optional Referer header value.}

\item{.req_options}{Named list of curl options passed to \code{httr2::req_options()}.}

\item{.handle_response}{Optional function \code{function(resp) ...} to post-process the response.}

\item{.json_auto_unbox}{If TRUE (default), auto-unbox scalar JSON values for request bodies.}
