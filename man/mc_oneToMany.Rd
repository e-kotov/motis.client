\arguments{
\item{one}{geo location as latitude;longitude}

\item{many}{geo locations as latitude;longitude,latitude;longitude,...}

\item{mode}{routing profile to use (currently supported: \code{WALK}, \code{BIKE}, \code{CAR})

Allowed values: WALK, BIKE, RENTAL, CAR, CAR_PARKING, CAR_DROPOFF, ODM, RIDE_SHARING, FLEX, TRANSIT, TRAM, SUBWAY, FERRY, AIRPLANE, BUS, COACH, RAIL, HIGHSPEED_RAIL, LONG_DISTANCE, NIGHT_RAIL, REGIONAL_FAST_RAIL, REGIONAL_RAIL, SUBURBAN, FUNICULAR, AERIAL_LIFT, OTHER, AREAL_LIFT, METRO, CABLE_CAR.}

\item{max}{maximum travel time in seconds}

\item{maxMatchingDistance}{maximum matching distance in meters to match geo coordinates to the street network}

\item{elevationCosts}{Optional. Default is \code{NONE}.

Set an elevation cost profile, to penalize routes with incline.
\itemize{
\item \code{NONE}: No additional costs for elevations. This is the default behavior
\item \code{LOW}: Add a low cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if small detours are required.
\item \code{HIGH}: Add a high cost for increase in elevation and incline along the way. This will prefer routes with less ascent, if larger detours are required.
}

As using an elevation costs profile will increase the travel duration,
routing through steep terrain may exceed the maximal allowed duration,
causing a location to appear unreachable.
Increasing the maximum travel time for these segments may resolve this issue.

Elevation cost profiles are currently used by following street modes:
\itemize{
\item \code{BIKE}
}

Allowed values: NONE, LOW, HIGH.}

\item{arriveBy}{true = many to one
false = one to many}

\item{withDistance}{Optional. Default is \code{false}.
If true, the response includes the distance in meters
for each path. This requires path reconstruction and
is slower than duration-only queries.}

\item{.return_as}{A string specifying the return format. Defaults to 'list'. Options are 'list' for a parsed R list, 'raw' for the raw httr2_response object, or 'string' for the raw JSON string.}

\item{.json_parser}{A string specifying which parser to use when .return_as = 'list'. Defaults to 'RcppSimdJson' (faster) or 'jsonlite'. Beware that their output may differ slightly.}

\item{.headers}{A named list of extra HTTP headers to add to the request. If no 'Accept' header is provided anywhere, 'Accept: \emph{/}' will be sent by default.}

\item{.auth}{An authentication token or method (e.g., a bearer token string).}

\item{.throttle_rate}{A number to pass to \code{httr2::req_throttle()} to limit the rate of requests. For example, \code{15/60} means 15 requests per minute. This overrides any default rate set at client generation time.}

\item{.build_only}{A logical. If TRUE, the function will build and return the httr2_request object without performing it. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{.server}{A string to override the base URL for this specific request. If provided, it will be used instead of the default server URL.}

\item{.endpoint}{A string to override the path for this specific request. If provided, it will be used instead of the default path from the specification. For example, use '/v2/users' to override the endpoint path.}

\item{.referer}{A string to set the Referer HTTP header.}

\item{.req_options}{A named list of curl options passed to \code{httr2::req_options()}. Useful for timeouts, proxies, SSL, etc.}

\item{.handle_response}{A function taking an \code{httr2_response} and returning a value. If supplied, it overrides \code{.return_as} / \code{.json_parser} handling. See helpers like \code{oa3_content_or_stop()}.}

\item{.json_auto_unbox}{Logical. If TRUE, JSON bodies are encoded with \code{auto_unbox = TRUE} (jsonlite). Defaults to FALSE unless overridden.}

\item{.paginate}{A logical, character string, or function to enable pagination. If TRUE (or "link_header"), uses Link headers. Other options: "page_param", "cursor_param", or a custom function. See \code{oa3_paginate()}.}
