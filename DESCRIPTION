Description: Autogenerated with 'openapi3' package, this API client for
    the MOTIS API provides functions to interact with all API endpoints by
    preparing requests and if needed, sending them using the 'httr2'
    package and returning as raw responses, json strings or parsed R
    lists. Optiinally request can be prepared without sending. This is a
    low-level client for developers who want to build higher-level
    abstractions using MOTIS as a backend. For user-facing applications
    consider using 'rmotis' package.
